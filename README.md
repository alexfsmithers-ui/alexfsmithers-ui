# Hi, I’m Alex 👋

I’m currently upskilling into **data quality, risk analysis, and cybersecurity-adjacent analytics**, with a focus on how incomplete or imperfect data affects real-world decision-making.

My background includes analytical, policy-adjacent, and operational work, and I’m now building **public, well-documented projects** to develop practical technical skills and judgement.

---

## What I’m working on

- 📊 Data quality and reporting risk analysis  
- 🛡️ Early-stage cybersecurity and operational risk signals  
- 🧠 Interpreting real datasets, not just cleaning or modelling them  
- 📓 Clear, reproducible Jupyter-based analyses with narrative context  

---

## How I’m learning

I learn by doing and documenting:

- Small, focused projects using real public datasets
- Emphasis on *why the data matters*, not just how to process it
- Clean GitHub repos with READMEs, notebooks, and reproducible environments
- Incremental progress shared openly rather than polished “finished” claims

---

## Featured projects

- **NHS data quality & risk analysis**  
  Analysis of missing Community Health Services submissions to explore how reporting gaps can signal operational or governance risk.

(More projects will be added here as I progress.)

---

## Current focus areas

- Pandas, Jupyter, and data visualisation for risk analysis  
- Data completeness, missingness, and reporting reliability  
- How data quality issues propagate into policy, operational, or security decisions  

---

## Philosophy

I’m interested in the space **between raw data and real-world decisions** — especially where uncertainty, incomplete reporting, or incentives can introduce risk.

I value:
- clarity over complexity  
- judgement over dashboards  
- reproducibility over flash
