# Hi, I’m Alex 👋

I’m building a technical foundation in data analysis, programming, and cybersecurity-aware risk assessment, with a focus on how data- and AI-driven systems behave in real organisational settings.

My work centres on understanding how incomplete, imperfect, or poorly governed data affects decisions — and how those risks intersect with system design, security, and misuse.

I’m developing this through public, well-documented projects that involve hands-on implementation as well as analysis, with the aim of being effective in technically grounded roles while building toward longer-term work in technology risk, governance, and decision-making.

## What I’m working on

- 📊 Data quality and reporting risk analysis  
- 🛡️ Early-stage cybersecurity and operational risk signals  
- 🧠 Interpreting real datasets, not just cleaning or modelling them  
- 📓 Clear, reproducible Jupyter-based analyses with narrative context  

---

## How I’m learning

I learn by doing and documenting:

- Small, focused projects using real public datasets
- Emphasis on *why the data matters*, not just how to process it
- Clean GitHub repos with READMEs, notebooks, and reproducible environments
- Incremental progress shared openly rather than polished “finished” claims

## Featured projects

- **NHS data quality & risk analysis**  
  Analysis of missing Community Health Services submissions to explore how reporting gaps can signal operational or governance risk.

(More projects will be added here as I progress.)

---

## Current focus areas

- Pandas, Jupyter, and data visualisation for risk analysis  
- Data completeness, missingness, and reporting reliability  
- How data quality issues propagate into policy, operational, or security decisions  

---

## Philosophy

I’m interested in the space **between raw data and real-world decisions** — especially where uncertainty, incomplete reporting, or incentives can introduce risk.

I value:
- clarity over complexity  
- judgement over dashboards  
- reproducibility over flash
